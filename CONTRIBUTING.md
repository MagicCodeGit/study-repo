# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're excited to see your ideas. To ensure a smooth process, please follow these simple guidelines.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Discuss First:** Before you start writing code, please open an "Issue" on GitHub to discuss the bug you want to fix or the feature you want to add. This helps us avoid duplicated work and make sure your idea aligns with the project's goals.

2.  **Create a Branch:** Once your idea is approved, create a new branch from `main`. Please use a descriptive name, for example:
    *   `feature/add-user-authentication`
    *   `fix/correct-login-validation`

3.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, add your documentation, and make your changes within your new branch.

4.  **Commit Your Work:** Please follow our commit message guidelines. Each commit should be small, logical, and have a clear message. We use the **Conventional Commits** standard (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`).

5.  **Open a Pull Request:** When your work is ready, push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request to the `main` branch. Provide a clear title and a good description of what you've done.

We appreciate your contributions and will review your Pull Request as soon as possible. Let's make this project better, together!
